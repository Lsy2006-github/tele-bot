# STEP 3: MongoDB (cloud database, will have a recording)
- In this database, try not to store any data that are sensitive (eg. HP number, name etc.)
as the database is not secured for this purpose & it's more of real-time updates :))

- Head over to this link: https://www.mongodb.com/
- Sign up for an account
- Once signed in, click on Cluster & create a new cluster.
- Choose the FREE tier cluster.
- Once completed, follow the instructions prompted & choose Python as the language.


# STEP 4: Cloud Hosting
- This ultilises Google Cloud for the cloud hosting. You can get $300 free credit by
entering a billing card. But can just delete whole setup, including the card from the project
after camp has ended to prevent additional costs.
